## Agent Routing Logic

The system intelligently routes queries based on keywords and context:

### Flight Agent Triggers
- Flight bookings, airlines, air travel
- Flight search, tickets, airports
- Departures, arrivals, airline prices
- Examples: "Book me a flight", "Find flights to Paris"

### Hotel Agent Triggers
- Hotels, accommodations, stays, rooms
- Hotel bookings, lodging, resorts
- Hotel search, hotel prices
- Examples: "Find hotels in Tokyo", "Where should I stay"

### Itinerary Agent Triggers
- Travel itineraries, trip planning
- Destinations, activities, attractions
- Travel advice, weather, culture, food
- Examples: "Plan my trip", "What to do in Rome"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure all API keys are set in `.env`
2. **Chainlit Import Error**: Run `pip install chainlit`
3. **Memory Issues**: Check LangGraph checkpoint configuration
4. **SERP API Limits**: Check your SERP API quota and billing




## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Agent Prompts
Modify agent prompts in the `_setup_agents()` method to customize behavior:
- Flight agent: Adjust date parsing and airport code handling
- Hotel agent: Modify search parameters and result formatting
- Itinerary agent: Customize planning approach and recommendations

### Memory Configuration
Adjust conversation memory settings:
```python
# In _build_workflow()
checkpointer = InMemorySaver()  # For development
# For production, consider persistent storage
```

### Tool Configuration
Customize API parameters:
```python
# Flight search parameters
params = {
    'currency': 'USD',  # Change currency
    'gl': 'us',         # Change country
    'hl': 'en',         # Change language
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **API Rate Limits**: Monitor your API usage to avoid rate limiting
2. **Response Time**: SERP API calls may take 3-5 seconds


## Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
chainlit run app_with_ui.py
```
